# Restaurant Reviews App Stage 1

## Project Overview:
This project converts a static webpage to one that is mobile-ready.

In stage 1 of this project I added the following:
* Accessibility
* Responsive design
* Ability to use the webpage offline

### How to grab and run the webpage.

1. Download my project repository from the following location: https://github.com/jphan9/Restaurant-Reviews-App-Stage-1.git
2. Make sure you have either Python 2.x or Python 3.x installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. In a terminal or command prompt, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.
4. Once the server is running visit the project by going to `http://localhost:8000` or whatever port you had chosen.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:
This project uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
